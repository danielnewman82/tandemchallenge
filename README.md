My solution for Tandem's apprenticeship code challenge. Since I have the most experience working with the MERN stack, I made my
solution a simple React app. No other dependencies, just the standard ones that Create-React-App includes. And really, I'm pretty
sure there's nothing in here beyond the basic React rendering functions and vanilla JS, with a pinch of CSS to make it look nicer. It doesn't even need multiple components, everything gets done by App.js.

It was tricky, took me the better part of a day to figure out. (Don't you hate it when you're in deep hack mode, and then you have to stop and deal with some trivial real-life stuff?) But I'm pretty happy with it; the only issue I know of is that, if you modify the code and let the development server hot-reload, it may render an extra copy of the correct answer button. But that clears up with a quick refresh. And then, the score updates with each question, it tells you if you were right, and if you were wrong, it gives the correct answer. After 10 randomly selected questions (with the answers randomized so they're not in the same order every time), the game ends and reports your final score.
